3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
By manually choosing when to create a commit is good when we have change it period wise and also it is easy when we have to make commit regularly.But if we don't want to change any commit or we know what is written and want to complete our work faster than it is good to have versions automatically saved .

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think some version control systems,like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit because it becomes easy to treat them .

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log we can see repository of a file and with git diff we can compare two commits in that file .

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By using version control I have many ideas and using this day by day makes me feel more confident .
